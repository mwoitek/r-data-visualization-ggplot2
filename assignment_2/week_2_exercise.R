# Your objective is to replicate these figures, created using the Cooperative
# Congressional Election Study data. These figures are similar to those we
# completed in the lecture videos.
#
# ### Put your name here: Marcio Woitek
#
# ## Exercise 1
#
# Hints:
#
# * For the x-axis, use the variable `ideo5`.
# * Make sure you recode the data for the `ideo5` variable to generate the
#   correct names for the x-axis. You will want to consult the codebook.
# * Use the fill aesthetic to have R fill in the bars. You do not need to set the
#   colors manually.
# * Use `guides()` to drop the legend.
# * Make sure the axis labels and figure title are correct.

# ## Exercise 2
#
# Hints:
#
# * For the x-axis, use the variable `pew_religimp`.
# * Make sure you recode the data for the `pew_religimp` variable to generate the
#   correct labels for the x-axis. You will want to consult the codebook.
# * Rename the column for ideology to make sure the first letter is upper-case
#   (to make the legend appear correctly).
# * Use the fill aesthetic to have R fill in the bars. You do not need to set the
#   colors manually.
# * Make sure the axis labels and figure title are correct.

# ## Exercise 3
#
# Instructions:
#
# * For this visualization, you are creating your own data for practice.
# * Create a tibble/data frame with three columns: Semester, Student, and Grade.
# * There should be six semesters and three students (Amanda, Betty, and Carol).
# * Create grades for the students using the `runif()` command, with values
#   between 80 and 100. Hint: you'll need 18 grades total.
